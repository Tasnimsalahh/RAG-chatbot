Assessing the Iranian Strikes Against Israel The Iranian attack on Israel has sparked a divide among specialists and strategic experts within think tanks and specialized centers for strate gic studies.

The attack, executed using a combination of 185 drones in cluding the Shahid 136, Shahid 149, Mohajer-6 Quds, as well as 110 sur face-to-surface missiles and 36 cruise missiles, can be analyzed through two main themes: Limited and Symbolic Iranian Attack Against Israel\n\nIran s Attack on Israel: Assessment, Repercussions and Scenarios 9 Iran In recent years, Iran has faced significant strikes targeting its military leaders by the United States and Israel.

These operations have not only embarrassed the Iranian government before domestic and regional audiences but also es tablished a new rule of engagement, where Iran responds with condem nation and threats rather than direct retaliation to such strikes. Given this context, the most important repercussions of the attack on Iran are\nnation and threats rather than direct retaliation to such strikes. Given this context, the most important repercussions of the attack on Iran are as follows: The Iranian establishment restoring its prestige before the public: The attack allows the Iranian establishment to reclaim its prestige in the eyes of the Iranian people by demonstrating its capability to strike Israel directly when Iranian red lines are crossed. This action strengthens the\neyes of the Iranian people by demonstrating its capability to strike Israel directly when Iranian red lines are crossed.
